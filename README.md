# How To Use GitHub Pages To Make Web Sites While Learning Code?

### Like GitHub with training wheels, it's an easier way to code open source.

## GitHub Pages

People use GitHub to host projects ranging from music composition to cookbooks to municipal data.

But what you might not know is that GitHub isn’t just a storage locker, but also a showcase.

That is, GitHub allows you to set up a bare-bones website you can use to display projects and collaborate.

Welcome to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), the glossy, forward facing side of the site.

Unlike the dense repositories that would confuse your less tech-savvy friends, Pages are ordinary looking websites that GitHub hosts for free.

GitHub Pages, which are a bit like Git with training wheels, let you explore repository building without ever leaving the website.

No command line coding here: GitHub Pages lets you make a documented change, or "commit," to the site simply by clicking “OK.”

## Why Use Pages?

If you’re looking for an out-of-the-box website, Pages isn’t that, though McCullough hopes that the service will eventually have more user-friendly options. 

Right now, people choose to use Pages for the same reason they choose to use GitHub—it’s ideal for collaboration.

All Pages blogs are open source, so anyone can view the repository side of the site, look for bugs, and submit a pull request to the user.

Of course, nobody can alter the site except the owner, who can choose to approve these pull requests or not.

As an example, McCullough shows off the GitHub Teaching site. From the Pages side, it’s spartan, but familiar.

But from the back side, it’s a repository where students can learn by making edits to the very site that’s helping them learn.

> “It’s nerdy and sticky and less polished. But I would say the ability for people to find a public website and make contributions that then get recorded with their name on it makes it worth it. Open source, open culture.”
